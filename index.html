                    <h3>Leslie's story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Leslie is from Ventura County in the southern California sun and loves stuffed orcas, eating, playing tennis, eating, airplanes, and stuffing her face with food. When she was little, she thought Chinese people were a dying race in America, since she was related to all the Chinese people she knew and none of them spoke any Chinese whatsoever. She thought a lot of small thoughts like how to make the world a better place and dreamed of treating neurological disease.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hanwen's story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hanwen was born in Shanghai and immigrated to the United States when he was 4 years old (actually 1 week before his 4th birthday) and proceeded to assimilate into American society. He's now a big fan all things American, like hot dogs and making things up based on whatever he thinks. He grew up in the suburbs of the East coast and dreamed of big things, like living next to a Carl's Jr. so he could eat spicy chickens for $1 and watching <em>300</em> in Blu-ray.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Caltech</h3>
                    <p>
                        Both Leslie and Hanwen attended Caltech and were members of the venerable Lloyd Hovse, which produced some of the finest clowns/friends known to either of them. They basically never talked at Caltech and didn't really know each other at all, even though they had the same major and “saw” each other almost daily. She was too busy dating all of Hanwen's best friends and Hanwen was busy playing Guild Wars (the greatest game ever), Left 4 Dead, DotA, Dawn of War, Super Smash Bros...
                    </p>
                    <h3>Together at last</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hanwen graduated from Caltech in 2008 and started working in the San Francisco bay area because he heard great things about the culture there, how it was egregiously full of nerds unlike the East coast so he thought he would fit in great. He was able to achieve both of his dreams in 2009, when he lived next to a Carl's Jr. and bought a PS3 to watch <em>300</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leslie graduated from Caltech in 2010 and started her doctorate at the University of California, San Francisco, one of the premier health sciences universities in the world. She wanted to continue her quest researching Alzheimer's which played a huge role in her life as her grandfather had it before she went off to college.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They got together in the fall of 2011 and fell in love at different paces: Leslie fell in love with Hanwen's dreamy body and amazing personality. Hanwen fell in love with Leslie slowly due to some of her amazing qualities, like being female and existing in irresistibly close proximity. Their relationship is built on a foundation of respect (“what’s wrong with you?”), honesty (“be there at 7” show up at 11), trust (“you have house keys? show me!”) and communication (“...huuUHH??”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For actually nice things they think about each other, stay tuned for the reception showing of their wedding video. They’ll try to come up with some nice things to say by then.

                        Whatever you want! ...as long as you’re wearing something. Casual is fine, though we’ll still let you in the door if you’re in full formal attire. It’s a coastal town in November, so have a light jacket handy. The reception is primarily indoors.

                    <p>If you’re visiting from out of town, here are some other things you can do in the area:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beach: Ride bikes, surf, laze about, eat, shop, do beach stuff (it tends to be windy and foggy, but sometimes it’s sunny and warm in November).</li>
                        <li>Downtown Ventura: beach town shops and restaurants. Also home to America’s Coolest jewelry store, <a href="http://instoremag.com/instore/america-s-coolest-stores/16674-big-cool-1-fox-fine-jewelry.html" target="_blank">Fox Fine Jewelry</a>, where Leslie and Hanwen made their custom wedding rings. </li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.premiumoutlets.com/camarillo/" target="_blank">Camarillo Outlet Mall</a>: Shopping here is Hanwen’s favorite thing to do when he visits--that and pretending to not speak English at the nearby <a href="http://www.thewaypointcafe.com/" target="_blank">Waypoint Cafe</a> at Camarillo Airport. Print coupons in advance and/or bring your AAA card to pick up a discount sheet at the Information Center (Suite 504).</li>
                        <li>Chik-fil-A: These don’t exist in the Bay Area, so this is a special treat for Leslie and Hanwen, who thinks “Chik-A-Fil” is even better than Carl’s Jr. Spicy Chicken Sandwiches.</li>
                        <li>Library with dogs: Leslie’s mom and Aunt regularly visit the Camarillo and Santa Paula libraries for reading sessions with dogs Finn, Riva, and Fila. They’ll be busy with reception stuff on Sat Nov 14, but you can go to the library anyway and see other dogs.</li>
                        <li>Patagonia: It’s made in Ventura. There’s a Patagonia store and outlet near downtown.</li>
                        <li>U-Pick produce: Although it’ll be November and there’s probably not much in season.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="whattobring">What to Bring</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just bring yourself. If you have a Nintendo console system controller, bring it (N64, Game Cube, Wii/U)--and make sure your name is on it so that it goes home with the right person. We aren’t having a designated official photographer, so if you don’t have a smartphone, bring a camera and send us your pictures after. Instructions to come for how to share pictures to us in a common cloud folder. Your presence is plenty! If you insist on presents with your presence, keep in mind Leslie and Hanwen live in a small Bay Area apartment (so don’t bring them anything enormous like huge stuffed animals--orcas excepted). Our dream is to move to a bigger place one day and raise alpacas. We’re also interested in remodeling our kitchen and bathroom. Instructions below for how to contribute if you’re so inclined.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        People have been asking about a registry so we've added this section to cover that. We have a small place in the San Francisco Bay Area and we don't need any actual things like dishes or lawn furniture, but we are thinking about updating our bathroom and/or kitchen so we're just having a Remodeling Fund. We also welcome any recommendations for contractors or places to buy material for our project. We're using <a href="https://cash.me/" target="_blank">Square Cash</a> so no one has to pay additional fees which most registries charge.
                    </p>
                    <p> Here are some fund tiers we've devised:</p>
                    <br>
